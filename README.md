# Otto DIY

This Repository have all open source files for Otto DIY an interactive robot that anyone can make!
Otto walks, dances, makes sounds and avoids obstacles.Is completely and truly open source, Arduino compatible, programmable, 3D printable.NO SOLDERING REQUIRED! 

This is the beginner version of Otto DIY if you want to try Bluetooth connection, APP control or more sensors please go to [Otto DIY+ (PLUS) repository](https://github.com/OttoDIY/PLUS)

## 1. Interact with other Otto builders
Join the [Otto builders group in facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ottodiy/)

## 2. Buy to build or make your own Otto!
Difficult to find all the parts? then buy quality kits [from our website only](https://www.ottodiy.com), is a way to contribute and support this project to continue growing, so we can continue offering very affordable kits and constantly creating new robots open for all.
After you have all components just follow the instruction manual in the files and build your own Otto in one hour!

If you want make Otto by yourself ;) that is great too! but do not forget to add your [marker in our google map!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qXEfuS5egbF14gi8EUjJ6U-dITHoJJNZ&usp=sharing)

## 3. Share your innovative creation with #OttoDIY
A redesign, modified code or if your creation is different but inspired in Otto; is technically a remix, so please share in our [Wikifactory Social & Design Platform](https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY) or please post that you have [made/remix an Otto in Thingiverse and add to this group](https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/ottodiy) or pull a request here in Github!

Keep sharing with us in any social media, tag friends, family with #OttoDIY and make sure more robot fans do the same everywhere, we love to see Otto robots around the world!

Please help us to spread out the word first in Maker Faires, Maker spaces, Hacker spaces, Schools, Universities, tech events and so on...

## 4. Otto DIY robot for STEAM education 
Educational deep content for STEAM centers, we already partner with many tech companies, entrepreneurs, educational centers and schools around the world, just contact us to be an official collaborator, we easily adapt to different curriculum or needs and we can leverage your ideas too!
Add your [organization in our google map](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qXEfuS5egbF14gi8EUjJ6U-dITHoJJNZ&usp=sharing) and do not hesitate to contact us

Stay active in our social media for contest and awards to the best Otto builders and as always so we will keep sharing this knowledge to the world and the humanity.

Truly opensource hardware!

## For the hardware
If you want to make by your own gather all electronic parts that you'll need for this assembly, then 3D print the latest .stl files and then follow the instruction manual PDF to build your own robot

## For the quick start programming and learners
1. Download mBlock.cc Version 3; is an opensource software for easy programming Robot by Drop and Drag blocks. Based on Scratch 2.0 (MIT), beside sharing the great feature of graphical coding of Scratch, mBlock also integrates an Arduino Code generator for upload program into any Arduino based Hardware.
2. Add the Otto DIY Extension in mBlock software, swtich in the menu to Arduino mode
3. Drag and drop functions, dance, sounds and conditionals from robot Otto blocks
4. Connect, select Arduino Nano 328 and check the USB COM port
5. Upload your own code and Otto will follow each block command.

Alternatively you can use [Arduino Blocks (based on Google Blocly)](http://www.arduinoblocks.com/web/project/20999) and [Kittenblock (based on Scratch 3.0)](https://kittenbot-docs-en.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kittenbot/02InstallKittenblock.html) 

## For the advanced programming
1. Download & Install Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software also this driver if you have a clone board: http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_EXE.html for PC, or http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_MAC_ZIP.html for MAC
2. Copy all libraries to C:\Users\user\Documents\Arduino\libraries (or wherever your library folder is installed):
3. Open  for example Otto_smooth_criminal.ino, make sure in tools you have "Board: Arduino Nano" "Processor ATmega328" and your Otto is connected to the corresponding USB port
4. Upload code to your Otto and will dance!
5. Make your own dance! just modify the Arduino .ino sketch code using same libraries and functions and do not forget to share.

### Otto was Design using Autodesk 123D Design software now is in Tinkercad!
[You can modify it for customization](https://www.tinkercad.com/users/h8O1zJQboeH-camilo-parra-palacio) or further improvements!

Otto was inspired by another robot BoB the BiPed and programmed using code from [biped robot Zowi](https://github.com/bqlabs/zowi)
Otto's differences are in the assembled size (12cm x 7cm x 12cm), accessibility, cleaner integration of component and gestures.
